And when you're fifteen
But no one notices until it's too
But you were just a temporary high.
I guess what you wrote on a paper
But you stayed.
Yeah you have got something they don't
I thought there for a little while
Flashback to the night when you said to me,
(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.
All because of Ellen
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
Trying just to get the girl
I still remember the look on your face
Won't see you again
And I forget about you long enough
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
So I drive home alone.
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
I had time to think it all over
A love so strong
I never miss a beat
New York... be here.
I could give you fifty reasons
Remember what you put me through,
I learned the dirt roads
It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah)
She could talk to you all night
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Kinda scared 'cause
Long live all the mountains we moved
I think--I think when it's all over,
Face to face and finally
In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
This I have previously learned.
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
Lead her up the stairwell
Was not it easier in your firefly-catching days?
Wishing I could slow down time
I say, 'Can you believe it?'
We never go out of style.
Screamed your name,
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
I can't take my eyes off of you
This daydream is dangerous
Something's gone terribly wrong
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
We stood there in the road
And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
To save the world or go to work
That don't do something for me
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
I go on too many dates <i>[chuckle]</i>
Oh, we’re invisible.
As you held her so close
Something happens when everybody finds out
But at night you live it all again
It don't make sense to me, but:
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Said are you there?
Can't help it if there's no one else.
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
Next year I could be just as good
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead
And it's always gonna get weird
Even when you're sleeping
Maybe I should have seen the signs, should have read the writing on the wall.
All the girls in the front row scream your name
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs, she is got Bette Davis eyes
We could ever be the same?
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I will meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
I haven't seen it in a while
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
Truth be told
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
So come on, come along with me
Ans we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
The other on my heart
Was she worth this?
Honey, life is just a classroom
I'd have never guessed
Realize that we won't make-up
It would be a fine proposition,
Still, all my life, I got money and power
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
And I go back to December...
I think that the worst part of it all was not losing him.
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
And i will bet, you thought you'd beat me,
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
The way you love with all you have,
Been losing grip,
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
But if you only knew me
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
And you can want who you want
Was not really from your heart
Dreaming of you baby
You say you love em, and baby without you,
Than have to say goodbye
Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
doctor says she is in the clear
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
To forget why I needed to...
I used to know my place was the spot next to you,
The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
She should keep in mind
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
It was months, and months of back and forth
Back up, baby, back up
All is calm and all is bright
You'd see that today holds something special
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
We are alone, just you and me
Trying to block you out 'cause I will never impress you
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
He says, 'God, I did not bring her up
My hands shake
And I was right there beside him all summer long
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Sneaking out late, tapping on your window
It could still be simple
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
I want our love to last forever
When I went looking for a reason, I know
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Something holy, not superficial?
I said remember this moment in the back of my mind
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
Will tell you it’s true
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Little that I knew
And what do you do when the one
Stay
Well, she was an American girl
Got nothing in my brain
And I will be loving you for quite some time.
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
But you're friction
I would give it all up to be
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me
Standing there all waiting on me
I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress
Now we got problems
Hey, hey, hey
And I would have been so happy.
And I don't think we can solve 'em
And she is got everything that I have to live without.
Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
Please take me dancing and
When they point to the pictures
I could dance to this beat
I wish you would come back,
No matter what you do.
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
And you will leave, got places to be and I will be OK
You did not mean it, baby,
I will be five in May
That was as good as our song...
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
That will have to be something I just say this year
But there's one thing missing,
But I know I had the best day
I'm the one who makes you laugh
That heaven is overrated
Take me back when our world was one block wide
And that's how it works
Take me home where we met so many years before
These simple words on his goodbye note
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
I was walking up
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.
I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
You gotta come on, come on
There's no time for tears,
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
It feels like one of those nights,
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
But I know I saw a light in you.
And yeah I might go with it,
I have got my big coat on
We should be together
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
On every day you loved me
Everything is wrong
And if you're missing me,
But we were in screaming color
Remind her how it used to be (yeah, yeah)
You pull me in
And people say things that bring you to your knees
So please don't take that away.
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
And he calls exactly when he says he will
I’ve been counting days and
Be good to yourself and be good to each other
But did you ever let go
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
Won't you come back to me?
Don't be afraid, please,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
The moment I can see it.
The night we couldn't quite forget
I'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore.
'Cause everyone we know is trying
But it gets five million hits on
My days once revolved around you
And that's how it works.
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
Someday I will be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)
I have been loving you for quite some time, time, time.
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
Oh, who you are is not what you have been
But do you honestly expect me to believe
It's kinda hard to aim.
Like a scared little boy?
But you don't know, what you don't know...
I run and run
Realized I loved you in the fall.
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
She is been in and out of hospital
But I don't wanna' go there anymore.
Come back... be here.
You're still an innocent.
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Don't you block me out tonight
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better
Fond gestures are exchanged
Remember how that lasted for a day?
And every time you're here
You're so in love that you act insane
Angelina’s got a pretty face
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
And all we know
So watch me strike a match
And I did not know if you knew
Keep you second guessing like
Now I just wanna be alone,
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
I can't even look at you
I remind myself you were meant to fly.
That's what they don't know
From three summers back
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter.
There is not nothing more right babe
And I love you for giving me your eyes
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
I could show you incredible things
There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
I was not that little girl you used to see
Love's a game, wanna play?
Here's to you and your temper
I have never been so wrapped up, honey
So many things that you wish I knew,
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
When we started home it started to rain
This slope is treacherous
Now I don't know what to be without you around.
And it all leads to this - our first kiss
so he calls me up and he is like, 'I still love you,'
Who changed his mind and we both cried
We're not talking about a week or two
But you’re so confused,
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad.
And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
He says, 'Baby girl, what's wrong with you?'
Pass around his old guitar
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Don't you dream impossible things?'
I really really hate that...
What will I do when my love comes to call?
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And come over here to say
If you say it with your hands
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
And why I have spent my whole life trying to put it into words
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
And did not she pray too
All I know is a new found grace
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
It's a bad sign, bad sign
It will be a year today
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with.'
Happy endings
So I can see
I say, 'There's nothing you can say to make this right again.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.
I know you by heart,
Cause for a moment a band of thieves
But honey I am no-one's exception,
They rode one hundred floors up just to come back down
So I cross my heart and hope for you
When they gave us our trophies
And I remember that fight
Until I see you again
And everything feels better,
I know people change and these things happen
Just take me home, yeah.
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Oh
I'd give all I have, honey
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
You put your arm around me for the first time
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
At fourteen there's just so much you can't do
Yes, I could tell you his favorite color is green
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
Just think while you have been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
They said love was complicated,
New to town with a made up name in the angel city,
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
He walks like summer and talks like rain
That July
Baby, like we stood a chance
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
Now you're half way out the door
All those times that you did not leave;
It's time
You're better off, you're better off
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And you will be mine and I will be yours
'Cause coming back around here
Still thinking we're together
hearing daddy maybe, I will be like you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you.'
To move the furniture so we could dance,
So fall back on me
Cause one second it was perfect
And they're all laughing,
When we said forever and always
But the start of an age
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
He never talked about being scared over the phone
When I saw you there across the room
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years
I’ve been being patient
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
There's something 'bout the way
I'm not a princess, this is not a fairy tale,
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
So don’t look now
Who's really bad at lying
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Baby I will show you, I will show you
You say 'Hi' to your friends you is not seen in a while
Is more than a reaction to your touch
Wishing the call was from you
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
In through the window I see her with you
She does not have too much to say
That cuts me to the core
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
Love is different
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
I was riding shotgun
A beautiful magic love there
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
Don't mind Gracie
And we pretended it could last forever
Crossing all my fingers
Staring at the sunset, babe
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
La la la la la la la
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used.
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
'Cause I loved you from the very first day
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And I wait around that old wishing well
Guess we're on the same flight
Fearless
ten months older, I will not give in
Not where the story line ends
Of all the years that we stood there
I don’t think that passenger seat
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
My one condition is
And that's the way I loved you
As I'm looking around the room,
...if you look like an angel.
And all the times I let you in,
But I'm not fine at all.
I just want it back the way it was before.
You will be the prince and I will be the princess.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
To a platinum mine, santa honey
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
If you into it
I think that you have found you even
But I'm ready to fly
In the back of my mind making me feel like
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
I hope you think that little black dress
And I will scream out the window
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I'm feeling like I have missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
You will see me
If you're somewhere,
I don’t know what else I can say.
'Cause I don't think you do. Oh.
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
And it rains in your bedroom
Maybe we will last
All that I know is
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
Won't let nobody hurt you
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughing.
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she is lucky 'cause
And you have called a hundred times
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
If I was a stupid girl,
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
Or maybe it’s you and your sick need
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
We had the perfect love story,
Hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
This love is difficult but it's real.
Hope you will feed with the crumbs she throws you
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey
Eye to eye
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
She is cheer captain,
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
The way you look, the way you laugh,
But moving on from him is impossible
Why you took everything i had, oh baby
You were mine
About you and me
Knock on wood and rope the moon
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks)
But I remember how it was back then
We are never ever ever getting back together,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
Cause I'm not your princess, this is not a fairytale,
'You know I haven't seen you around before.'
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
Welcome to New York
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect is not quite sincere no more
Honestly believe you'd be there,
I'm five years old
And let me know what you find.
Uh oh! (hey!)
And may all your Christmases be white
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
Can't you see
How'd we end up this way?
So many things that I forgot to say
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
See you make your way through the crowd
You find yourself at my door,
You kiss on sidewalks
But I don’t wanna’ have to go that far.
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
It did not go the way you planed,
I take a step back, let you go
You're better off, you're better off without him
This mad mad love makes you come running
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You have just gotta keep your eyes open
She will turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice
In my dreams you're touching my face
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
I guess it's too late
That has never seen a boat
I should say, hey, by the way...
And to the fella over there with the good hair
I did not really know her that well
To watch them lay her down.
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
Na, na, na, na, na
But darling, we found wonderland
Friday night beneath the stars,
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And I will look back in regret how I ignored when they said,
I remember when we broke up the first time
Never imagined we'd end like this
Something in his deep brown eyes has me saying
I guess the storm is over for you
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh,
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
She took him faster than you could say 'sabotage'
I only ask that you won't go again
I will be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Out on four four one
Wrote you a song, you should’ve known.
It's ever changing
Girl you got everything
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...
I need you tonight
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
And you don't know it do you?
Just you and me.
With a smile, baby, baby
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.
And everybody knows that.
And I don't know how it gets better than this
I know places, I know places
Her hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
Stay beautiful
Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
Won't let no one break your heart
Then finally she sees them
And her little family all dressed in pastel
If you were wondering
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
So, don’t say 'Yes', run away now,
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
he is been overseas
Our song is the way he laughs
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
By the way...
And I remember thinking…
Oh, cause it's not his price to pay
Is I know something now, know something now I did not before.
God smiles on my little brother
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
It will be a long time, long time going, going
You look like my next mistake
I hang on every word you say, yay
Take the towel out of my hair
The battle's in your hands now,
When you're standing on a mountain,
But when you think Tim McGraw
If you said you'd rather love than fight.
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
I should have let you know
Looking at it now
And really long brown hair
Stay.
So you were never a saint
And my old faded blue jeans
It's a new soundtrack
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
But not like this
I bet these memories
But I did not know it at fifteen
They will judge it like they know about me and you
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ha, wildest dreams, ah-ha.
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
That's how you lost the girl.
When he said forever and always
So I have got some things to say to you, ha.
They say I’ve always known
And when you take, you take the very best of me
Burning it down
And that's why he is spinning 'round in my head
he is close to my mother
You take my hand and drag me head first
Every one of us has messed up too
Lately I can never tell
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
So hey, let's be friends
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was 'Goodbye'.
Through it all nobody gets me like you do.
Are we out of the woods?
It's like a million little stars
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And lead me on forever
How we met and the sparks flew instantly,
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
Says, 'It's officer Tate.'
And all the young things line up to take your place.
And you will say
I get drunk on jealousy
Eight times now and I still remember
You're not sorry, no no oh
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how,
I never been on a plane
Someday I will be living in a big ole city
I'm only asking this because I think that
Say a single vow
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Well, it was kind of cold that night
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive
You don't know about me
Who feels the way I do
Love's pure light
I almost did not notice
I have known it all this time
The one we danced to all night long
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
Said I think I am finally clean
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
You belong with me?
Saying, 'It's gonna be alright.'
But there were strangers watching
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
My fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)
You belong with me.
The summer sings a lullaby
You belong with me,
But I don't believe you baby
Things are meant to happen like this
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now
And how to let go
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you will make it out alive.
Even if it's just pretend
Now I know
I like the way you'd hold me
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
Run your hands through your hair
Go save the world, I will be around
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
Driving home by the river side
You say, this crazy world's come undone
You can plan for a change in weather and time
Don’t you think nineteen’s too young
Thought you'd be here by now
Cause it rains in your bedroom
That you might not be the golden one
So we went on our way
As I turn out the light
And we caught onto something
And don't you know
There are people who you come back to
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Dreaming about you
You're a redneck heartbreak
This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Either way she did not tell anyone about her first ray of sun
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Had to do-oo, yeah
It's scary how things change
Firefly you drew me to you,
But this love is brave and wild
Where is this going?
We never go out of style
But they are where mine belong and
So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
The time we stood with our shaking hands
Oh baby, don’t persuade me
I like my music loud
But you're in London and I break down,
You said, 'I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
Inside and out
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I will leave my window open,
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
I can't help myself...
And we will sing hallelujah, we will sing hallelujah
And go back and turn it to rain
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made,
All I need is on the other side of the door
Baby but I figured you out
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
Lost your mind trying to get it back
I'm looking through your
All alone or so it seemed.
With lots of places to run to
On the mattress, whoa
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
And I wanted to know how that would feel
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
That I'm the one
I just wanna make sure,
Who I wanna be
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
4 AM, the second day,
And the people that we meet
But it's not cause were just sitting here
And down here from the ground I see who you are
With just me and my baby
I think you and I should stay the same.
I thought I had you figured out
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
And sometimes we don't say a thing;
If I had known what I'd known now,
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach
After all it was a great big world
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...
There's no you and i,
And letting go... and no one knows
But I understand it somehow
We, ooh, getting back together
Until we have found a town
In wonderland
You're here, You're eyes are looking into mine
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
Made you run and hide
Not before I knew how much I had to lose.'
Christmas must be something more
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
One look, dark room
he is just hiding out on the other side of town
I said, 'That's a lie.'
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
My mistake, I did not know to be in love
Why, tell me why
And ya feel the same way, same way
In burning red
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
And we're not speaking,
You walk me to the car
And I'm like... 'I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
Your precious heart
Well on my way
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Slow down, I know that
Every lesson forms a new scar
But you come back to what you need
I don't even know if I will know when I'm there
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I know you heard about me
You'd be here by now
But I liked it better when you were on my side.
You're the kind of reckless
All I need is to move on fast
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
Oh let me down slowly
Can't stop, won't stop
Watch him run across to Angelina
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough
Running around in circles
Asking you to stay
At a sunset the same night
In your room, all alone,
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
You took the time to memorize me:
This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
And I, I, I like it
You're beautiful
That I don't want you to go oh-oh..
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
An' I don't wanna get there too soon
On all my wasted time
So good to me, so right
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
Like you always do
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow.
If you could stay like that
He says look up
That you would walk away.
Radiant beams from thy holy face
She will lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes
Miracle,
in wildest dreams
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
I wake up, I'm alive
Jesus Lord at thy birth
I'm sorry (oh)
There is not nothing bout you that don't do something for me
With that same big loud opinion
To make them stop it.'
Our song is the way you laugh
And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
If what you are is a daydream
Oh, oh, oh
I won't tell nobody
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
I have been spending the last eight months
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
We'd never fight
But the cycle ends right now
Just two kids, you and I...
Why are people always leaving?
That when you feel the world is crashing
Crazier, crazier.
Seems the only one who does not see your beauty
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
My momma is in the kitchen, worrying about me
You did not mean it baby
It won't be easy taking her today.
Emily comes home from school,
You should’ve known.
Broken and scarred
You will be mine and I will be yours
I live down the street in a broken down house
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
Holy infant so tender and mild
Again
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Pauses, then says
Your guard is up and I know why.
I did not know what I would find
You never know what people have up their sleeves
So how can I ever try to be better?
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
American boy, living life as it goes
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
I'd rather take a blow
I'm sorry
I knew I was not gonna take this very well
And I just think you should, think you should know
That's how it works.
But I know you wish it was me,
Wonderful and strange
Before you go, tell me this:
I will meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
My thoughts will echo your name
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Oh, In the middle of the night
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
You carry me from your car up the stairs
One step, not much
But I never planned on you changing your mind
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
And all I wanna do is say
Does not he know that I’ve had him memorized for so long?
His strength is making me stronger
To hold on to each other
Should not a light go on?
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
I get what I want
Change anything anything
Where everybody stands and keeps score
And long, long live the look on your face
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But there were Christmases when you were mine
We will just drive down this road and pray it does not end
And crossing so many lines.
Yes, I remember what you said last night
He still hasn't called
Did not he call you?
Head back to the Milky Way
And I feel perfectly fine
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
In a Mustang with the top down
Vanished when I saw your face
All my friends are saying
Pierce the room like a cannonball
What I mean is...
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
Baby, you know all the right things to say
You can't feel nothing at all
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.
You got the keys to me
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
I imagine you are home,
Last December (last December)
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone
She said, 'He tried but there's just some things I won't do.'
I look around, turn the radio down
And all my single friends are jealous
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold
A song that sounds like a death march
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up
And it would have felt like,
Who love you like you do
Don't turn away now
So, baby, drive slow
Tall, dark and superman
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room.
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
Broke your heart, I will put it back together.
And you could know (oh-oh oh oh)
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.
You never met a mirror
Find yourself another
‘Cause I’ve been on the verge of
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
Maybe we won't
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Feeling like I just lost a friend.
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
So this is me swallowing my pride,
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
It's flawless,
Oh, all you had to do was stay
Yeah they will tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
You showed up just in time
But you came along and you changed everything
But I will leave my window open,
But nobody's listening
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
You touch me once and it's really something,
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
And force us into a goodbye
Walked in expecting you'd be late
People throw rocks at things that shine
Cause look just what I have found
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
But someone said
You will spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way.'
But they make it so tough
he is the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
'Cause we never go out of style
The simple things in life are always new
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
How you said you'd be here,
I don't think you do
It takes everything in me not to call you.
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
They're dimming the street lights.
I have got an i heart question mark
The highlight of my day
Everything has changed
And how you held me in your arms that September night
And if you asked me if I love him,
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
Tell them how I hope they shine
And something reminds you
But I know all his favorite songs
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin’
Is not life sweet?
In this moment now capture it, remember it
I read his words out loud
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
I guess I just lost my balance.
But all you are is mean
<i>[Taylor Swift:]</i> This is the last time I let you in my door,
We hang back, it's all in the timing
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I'd never gone with the wind
We were built to fall apart
As we’re lying on the couch
Last time I'm asking you,
Breaking pieces off with every lie
What if angels did not pay attention to
(Think we can solve them!)
You can hear it in the silence, silence
But here I am in the same old car,
Have you ever thought just maybe
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
Honey where are you?
Oh-oh
There's is not nothing bout you (there is not nothing bout you)
To put his kids to sleep
And you have still got it in your drawer even now.
His sister's beautiful, he has his father’s eyes
Make it last all night
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
That face of an angel
'Happy birthday to you',
With my hair undone
that's grown up, american boy
And your lover in the foyer does not even know you
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
And take for granted what you have.
The best people in life are free
I like the way you sound in the morning
You say we will never make my parents’ mistakes.
Hundred mile an hour lives
And I will get you, and get you alone
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
I can't help but wish you took me with you...
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Could be so mean
Do you even care?
Maybe you will drop what you're doing
And that magic's not here no more,
Call a cab,
Like we're made of starlight
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
But I will bet you want to
You smile that beautiful smile and
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Like we dream impossible dreams
Try and catch me now
That you did not look again into
You don't have to call anymore
Into my arms
Don't be afraid to
Red lips so hard to miss
Well that’s good enough for me
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Uh, oh, oh
Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
I have never been on the outside
We will rock our babies on that very front porch
That I can withstand
Wish I'd never grown up
Show me a light
There are no accidents in what we do
Try and stay out of everybody's way
And it never would have gone away, no
While she waits up,
And that was the moment I knew.
I want to be where...
I like the way I can't keep my focus
Stood there and watched you walk away
And the story’s got dust on every page,
But I feel a responsibility,
Then fall back together (back together)
I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Stripped to the bone
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
Screaming, 'This is absurd!'
You said, 'I will never leave you alone.'
And turn it inside out.
And you will add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
Heart beat steady
For just us to know
But we’re faster and never scared
All the roses
<i>[Sammy Adams:]</i>
I saw the footage from the roof
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Pretends he does not know that he is the reason why.
you and I are painting pictures in the sky.
Who took all of their problems out on me.
Tell me why..
And I say,
Ooh ooh he is talking crazy
And said, 'I'm sorry, I did not make it,'
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
Daddy's smart
And I realize the blame is on me
Walls of in sincerity,
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Stealing other people's toys
Your beautiful eyes
I hug your legs and fall asleep
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
You might have him but haven't you heard
You're really gonna be someone,
You have got a girl at home,
And don’t wait for the sky to clear.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.
Please don't bring me down
You're my Achilles heel
You see me in hindsight
You make me crazier, crazier
And then you're on your very first date and he is got a car
And every time I look at you, it’s like the first time.
And I'm comfortable
And I'm on the bleachers.
Let's see if you believe in me
And you're feeling like flying
My friends and enemies
Swimming in the water tank
And you know everything about me.
I gotta have you,
Can't stop, won't stop moving
Let me want you.
Ooh, we called it off again last night
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
And I'd say
That principles office and says,
Instead of just invisible.
I will be right here on the ground
But if God forbid fate should step in
You were all I wanted
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
You're in love
And I see your face in every crowd.
This revolution, the time will come
'Hey, is not this easy?'
There are people you just come back to
Christmas must be something
And you can’t see me wanting you the way you want her
And I’m not perfect you could say
He is in love
And now you ask about you and i,
We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
I wish I'd never grown up
I know this should not be a lonely time
You understand perfectly,
I live my whole damn life
That should send me running
Shifting eyes and vacancy
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
‘Cause that’s all I’ve ever known
Yeah, they will tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
I can only love you
The street looks when it's just rained
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...
Why..do you have to put down my dreams
Everyday now they're talking war
But you're untouchable
Santa baby, a fifty four convertible, too, light blue
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.
And now you have got me alone,
But you know you got a mean streak
I can see the look that's in your eyes
Lost your balance on a tightrope.
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
And he said,
When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
It was the end of a decade
Do you believe in miracles
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
This love, this love, this love, this love...
I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
'Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
We was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that)
Burn toast, Sunday
Make you many friends
And did not he pray too?
Nearly killed me the day
It's two A M and I'm cursing your name
No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
And they say I’ve always known
Go save the world, I will be around...
This hope is treacherous
That’s the closest to a cowboy
It was good never looking down.
Waiting for her love to find her
And the tractor rides
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
I don't always have to be alone.
I was so sane and grounded
I won't tell my friends
So come feel this magic I have been feeling since I met you.
You paint me a blue sky
Oh yeah
I put the magazine down
I never would have played so nonchalant.
And I need you like a heart beat
Praying the floor won’t fall through, again
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
And guns
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
Let it take me where it wants to go
All roads—they lead me here.
You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
And whispers turned to talking
You should have been there,
And every day is like a battle
Help but wish I could see your face
Everybody's watching
But I'd rather you be mean
I guess you're in New York today,
Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
I have been an angel all year, santa baby
Did not they need you bad enough?
You held on tight to me
Trained to get along
So I can save them for a rainy day
I hope your life lead you back to my front door.
Like any real love
I really do believe in you
Oh, la, la
I'd rather hear the truth
I tried to catch you, but I can't
To see that little girl's smile.
And I will go sit on the floor
Even now just looking at you feels wrong
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
He says, 'What you have heard is true but I
I was begging you, 'Please don't go'
Goodbye, baby
She was not brought up that way.'
Mad about him
People like you always want back the love they gave away
Sitting on the fence posts
It's never too late to get it back.
And he says you look beautiful tonight
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
I know, I know, I just know
This is falling for you when you are worlds away.
Do you recognize me
Before he taught me how to lie
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
There was nothing left to say when it all came down
Just to please you, she is got Bette Davis eyes
But she wears short skirts
And there in the bathroom,
I wish I could keep you
Morning, his place
Been here all along.
Did not she call you?
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
I have been waiting for you.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.
But I will never look
Stupid girl,
You and I got lost in it
And you smile and say, 'How are you? '
And swords and weapons that you use against me
How we don't have a song'
twenty two, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
And life was never worse but never better
he is better than I am
It's so romantic
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
In the clear yet?
Can you feel it now?
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Ignoring words that you were saying
Somehow you made it through
Just like a line in an old love letter
And they say little girls have big dreams
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
So shame on me now
So glad you were around
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Late to do anything
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
Than love and lie
But right now my time is theirs
you're better off without him
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.
Dream about your eyes
I'm not afraid
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you have got to),
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
Think of all the fun I have missed
And never makes me wait
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
In my life I have been hammered by some heavy blows
Hoping you would come around
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
You, with your words like knives
'I’m holding every breath for you...'
I say, 'I hate you,' we break up, you call me, 'I love you.'
Has ever looked this good to me
But here's something you should know that is for sure
There’s the silence, there’s my last chance.
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky,
She is ferocious
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar
(Look what you have done)
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
Calling me out when I'm wounded
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
All those other girls –
That the towers up in flames
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
Now I know what a fool I have been
And we know it's never simple, never easy.
But in a box beneath my bed
And I must have been crazy to let you get away
They will tell you I'm insane
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be
I love you, and that's all I really know.
Your eyes whispered, 'Have we met?'
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
You never did, you never did
As I paced back and forth all this time
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
Makes your head spin round but
he is the time taken up, but there's never enough
Just you and me...
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
'I did not bring her up
Oh, yeah, hey
I would wait forever and ever,
I took a chance, I took a shot
I hope you think of me
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
This is the worthwhile fight
This is when the feeling sinks in,
And it’s a sad picture,
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
But I have got a blank space, baby
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I'm counting every day
Watches
But all I want is to have you back
Merry Christmas everybody
'Cause my God died for me.'
And darling, it was good never looking down.
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
So this is me swallowing my pride
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name –
You're gonna believe them
And everything that we could be
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
And it's not theirs to speculate
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Then you took me by surprise
But girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.
he is so tall and handsome as hell
To catch me now
You say you're fine I know you better than that.
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And you were wild and crazy
I can't help myself.
Drop everything now
Oh, yeah, yeah
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
Christmas lights glisten,
I will bet you got your mom another sweater
Another mess i did not plan,
Come running headlong into my arms
They're not talking a week or two
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
Washed my sins on the neon lights
Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
I know you're not scared of anything at all
We are alone with our changing minds
In a big city, they just dropped me off
And I'm still not over you
i want to be somewhere where you are
You say that you can't live without me.
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
And I can picture it after all these days.
And bring on all the pretenders
So here I am in my new apartment
So many walls up I can't break through.
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
And it said
Or it's gonna go down in flames
And asking me about you,
We learn to live with the pain
Getting swept away
Breaking down and coming undone
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
I wonder if you know
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
I find myself something decent to wear
Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
Please take my hand and
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
To get knocked off our feet
No apologies. He will never see you cry,
I like my windows down
Just try to never grow up, never grow up
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
And all that you were
I go to work, work all day
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I had so many dreams
Wishing you were at my door
Taking pictures in my mind
And I knew from the first note played
'I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better),
And the cynics were outraged
I said, 'No one has to know what we do, '
So I can scream
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
I'm thirteen now
Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
I always get it
Go save the world I will be around
And for one desperate moment there
On the outside looking in
Your eyes are dancing
What would happen if God never let it snow?
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
This place is too crowded.
And for the first time I had something to lose,
Baby, burn...
Something holy, not superficial
As far as I'm concerned you're
She is always asks me who I'm dating
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Your very first day
You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board
<i>[Album version:]</i> Taking flight, making me feel right
is not it funny, rumors fly
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.
And say you want me.
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
La la la
And when you're home alone at night,
This love is alive back from the dead
Is 'My god, he’s beautiful.'
And your shoulders brush
He said, 'Let's get out of this town,
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.
And I just wanna tell you
In the heat of the fight I walked away
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
Begging you, 'Please don't go'
Was that little girl's smile.
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
I still miss you
'Cause all I know is we said, 'Hello.'
And I don't wanna get there too soon
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
But I can't make them stay
But the very next day, you gave it away
I was screaming long live that look on your face
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
Find out what you want
Did some things you can't speak of
And it was a long time coming
We sing it proudly
I guess heard you wrong
Forever going with the flow,
Your time is running out,
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
Cause I'm feeling things I have never felt before
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
A long drive,
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
The playful conversation starts
Face to face but never eye to eye
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
Your little hands wrapped around my finger
If you're out there,
Saying, 'This is it, I have had enough,' 'cause like
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
May your days be merry and bright
I can make all the tables turn
And they say little girls are so naive
That's what people say,
I know places
She will expose you, when she snows you
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.
he is got a one-hand feel
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
'He said he'd be here.'
And she is not what you think
Why you gotta be so mean?
I drive around this town
So don't let nobody take that away.
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
But you were everything to me,
It's how you get the girl, girl.
I'm starting to think one day I will tell the story of us,
Yesterday I found out about you
And I know for you, it's always me
Please take down the
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I guess some people come <i>[?]</i> and purpose she
'Oh my God, who is she?'
I have got no one to believe in
And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)
But turn around (turn around), oh they have surrounded you
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
It's 2 AM in your car
She had one little promise she was gonna keep
'Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me.'
And the note that said...
A part of this, a part of you
I won't pick up the phone
This is not Hollywood, this is a small town,
Eh eh
It's alright, just wait and see
And it gets kinda weird
If you keep me next to you
So bright
Buttons on a coat
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
But I do
She don’t even know you.
I'm so glad you made time to see me.
She don’t even know you,
And I guess I wished on a plane
I will put his picture down
They can talk forever, they just don't know better
She felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
You always knew how to push my buttons
And I count the colors in his eyes
And they tell you that you’re lucky.
And I know everything about you
Oh baby let me miss you
He opens up my door and I get into his car
As long as they don't touch
And I could go on and on, on and on
I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
But this love is ours
That is fine I will tell mine that you're gay!
I said, 'I have been there, too, a few times.'
Trying to make me stay
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye
I know what I want
Somewhere back inside a room
When my world wakes up today
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
But you have got something they don't
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
Where I stand and say
We hadn't seen each other in a month
He was long gone when he met me
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
It's just me and my baby
Body bumped, bruised
Cried the whole way home, I should have known.
Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
Please don't be in love with someone else
Every night for so long, baby
And lost and thrown away
If you check off my Christmas list
And for the first time what's past is past
Grab your passport and my hand
Written on the back of my hand
You have been good, busier than ever,
And there you are on your knees,
I guess you did not care, and I guess I liked that
‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name.
twenty two, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Is that the day holds something special
Makes you wanna run and hide
You should have said 'No', baby, and you might still have me
But I couldn't find wings
Stare right into my eyes
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
You said I do and I did too
I have been a lot of lonely places
You come around and the armor falls
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
But I have to.
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
We will take this way too far
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
But somehow I know I
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And by the way
Can you see it now?
Silent night, holy night
You thinking you and me...just met
Fresh from your war
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
So they follow me down the hall,
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine.
and right before your eyes,
And I just wanna see you back at my front door.
You're just another picture to burn
But I don't know if I should.
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
But they never blind me, me
And last Christmas
The lingering question kept me up
Sleep in heavenly peace
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
<i>[Taylor Swift:]</i>
Cause it's tragedy and it will only bring you down,
So turn that car around
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
With this song for you
You stand with your hand on my waist line
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
So they could shut her out.
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
And all your little brother's favorite songs
The weight of the world
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend
I don't think so, oh oh oh
And if she had to die trying
She will never notice how you stop and stare
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
And I used to say, 'Never say never...'
When you're young you just run
The way you move when you walk by
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.
When we decided (we decided)
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you,
Wanted something more
The first date: 'Man, I did not kiss him, when I should have'
And then you say,
You give me everything and nothing
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
It's just another day
Did not he need you bad enough?
Guessing
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
I will catch you, I will catch you
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
When you feel the world is crashing
I'm feeling like I don't know you
Breathe without you
the dream of an american boy
He stands there, then walks away
I was just thinking
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I shake it off, I shake it off
But now I will go sit on the floor
He kissed his wife good bye
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
By the way
Was not it beautiful running wild until you fell asleep
And you don't know, what you don't know...
That watch him as he is walking home
You could have been getting down to this sick beat.
So hurry down the chimney tonight
You called me later,
In words that nobody knows
At least then I would know
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Oh, it's so sad to
I could go back to every laugh,
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
<i>[Bridge:]</i>
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
I have been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
Ooh,
For the things that she does
Kaleidoscope of loud
If I hadn't once been just like her.
Back roads was a better way
It seems the last thing on your mind
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
Could have sworn you said you loved me
You said you never met one girl
Sometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
I felt your arms twisting around me
I wanna tell you why
Oh, don't you ever grow up
<i>[Bridge]</i>
And tell her you're coming home,
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We will be out of here as soon as we can
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
Wake up and smell the break-up,
And it's taken me this long
Girls and girls
There's nothing left to beg for
You would before you said, 'It's not that easy.'
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
In my mind
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
Thinking 'bout everything we have been through
I thought it was a star,
(Hold on) and I can see it,
It was a moment of weakness and you said, 'Yes.'
And so it goes
And I know it's long gone,
She looks at life like it's a party and she is on the list
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Lightning and thunder
You are in love
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
<i>[Both]</i>
We don't have to do things their way
‘Cus I’m too tired at night for all these games.
Slow
With the dawn of redeeming grace
But you got here early and you stand and wave
But I won’t cause
As he runs his fingers through his hair
And he says...
Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
I’m shining like fireworks
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
He respects my space
And I hope you know that every time I don't
And lead me up the staircase
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
For me and my baby
Raised on promises
I grew up in a pretty house
Over your sad empty town
There I was again tonight
 eyes are like a jungle
In silent screams,
I’m laughing 'cause I hope he is wrong
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
Give you one last wave
Everybody's waiting
Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it
I should have known, I should have known
You can see that I have been crying
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
Don't wanna hurt anymore
I wish I could keep you,  firefly
And said oh my my my...
Hey Stephen,
And make my way into this breezy night
And it took some time, but I understand it now.
Like passing notes in secrecy
I did not bring her here
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on
Keep your feet ready
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny <i>[CD version]</i>
Won't lose you again
That I'm only up when you're not down.
And she said
Did not it all seem new and exciting?
I could still be little
Even when I was wrong
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
As I say hopelessly,
She could see the cars roll by
Catching stars and fireflies
And now you say,
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
About that time, you call me
Was it everything you wanted to find
Holding her hand
I think he can see through everything but my heart
Double platinum wherever she go
Come back and tell me why
A perfect little dream inside my head,
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
Oh, oh.
Oh, just know I’m right here hoping,
Strange look on his face
And you open your eyes into mine,
Yeah...
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
We’re getting stronger now
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
And you don't know how nice that is
Only thing that kept me alive
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.
Boys only want love if it's torture
And I won't be alone tonight
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
You have pointed out my flaws again
Put your lips close to mine
And he is all that I need to fall into.
They put her momma in the ground.
Meet me in the pouring rain,
Four blue eyes
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
We won't be sleeping.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.
I'm only up when you're not down.
Head back toward the Milky Way
I walk with my head down
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
Say you will see me again
Every time I'm on this show
Can't go back, I'm haunted
But I would lay my armor down
And I will never (never) be the same
And I can't breathe without you
he is charming and endearing
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
And I don't think we can solve them
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate.
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Hey
You will have new September
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
Now you know
When you say our love could last forever
And...
Oh, it's too late
But you're still gone, gone, gone
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
It's gonna take it a while to love again
We will just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
I hear your laugh
And you looked at me, got down on one knee
I will fight their doubt and give you faith
You'd run around
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
I wear sneakers.
I know that you is not used to no
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
We're on the phone and without a warning
So may your days be merry and bright
I used to think that we were forever ever
See the vultures circling dark clouds
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
You'd better keep it to yourself
And I love the riddles that you speak
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
I walk to school and I wear a cross
Before
Uh, uh
He said, 'Sir, there's been an accident.
Take away the pain
There are people that you come back too
It's the first kiss,
The first time you ever saw me cry.
And put a wreath up on your door
I did not read between the lines
I would wait forever and ever.'
Last time I'm asking you this...
Too weak to run
There's a glow off the pavement
He stood up and said, 'That's funny,
I swear I will be with you someday
Of who can act like they care less,
Now all we know is don't let go
First thought when I wake up
If you and I are a story
One day, we will be remembered
'Cause she does not get your humor like I do.
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
So why did you go away?
Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
She is cheer captain
The first date: 'Man, I did not kiss her, when I should have'
You and me
You lift my feet off the ground
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
All I knew this morning when I woke
They never thought you'd make it this far
I will never get to hold,
But I do, I do
We almost never speak
Will you ever know?
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I had to catch my breath
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Tall, dark and beautiful
I have heard every album, listened to the radio
They might be bigger
All I know is we said, 'Hello.'
He says, 'Baby is something wrong?'
I'd be
These hands had to let it go free
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
When there's something really wrong,
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Back now that it's just too late
I want you forever and ever.'
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
That’s just another thing
Trust me, mine is better
And moved on
I will pray for you and me and hope I’m right
Every time you smile, I smile
Don’t know if I could
I try not to fall apart,
I will be strong, I will be wrong, oh but life goes on
Good girls, hopeful they will be and long they will wait
Don't you make cry tonight
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
And I had space to run
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'm a house of cards
Please don't leave tonight
But now we have stepped into a cruel world
Away
And he just might make me smile
But I was there to watch you leave,
The girl in the dress
Cause Every time you smile, I smile
And I can't trust anything now
I thought heaven can't help me now.
I will run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
I mean it, I mean it.'
You're about to lose your girl,
Know exactly where it leads but I
Spelling out your name
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
Oh, I can't leave yet
Oh, baby, smile...
You might have him but I always get the last word
and people would say, 'They're the lucky ones.'
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I know it's right for you
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
No proof, not much
When I'm in this dream
She will expose you when she snows you
Wishing the card was from you
You have a way of coming easily to me
Everybody knows that.
You always let someone come in between
Don’t need the real thing
I’ve been thinking maybe
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
But you are not the kind of boy
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine
But I watched all of it fade
People ask me how I have been
The village is aglow
'Cause you know I love the players
Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Trying to survive
I sneak in and see your friends
Shake it off, I shake it off,
In the pouring rain
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
And that was the first day.
Put my name at the top of your list,
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
he is not all bad like his reputation
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
Cause you're my lullaby
And the hours pass by,
But someday I will be living in a big ole city
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.
Someday I will be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Just for you to go again,
But the story of us might be ending soon.
Instead of sleeping.
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
Romeo, save me, I have been feeling so alone.
You wear your best apology,
The phone rings on a rainy night
You had it figured out since you were in school.
I had a lot about you and i,
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
In the palm of its hand
Anything
What I wanted, it’s true
She will open up the door and say, 'Are you insane ('ane)?'
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
But I'm feeling twenty two
(out of style)
And there was nothing else I could do
To give love then take it away
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
Did not she need you bad enough?
I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Watched him catch the ball
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
SO baby come hold me tight cause I-I
He will never fall in love he swears
Business and relationships
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
‘Cus I’m too tired at night to call your name.
All is quiet in the world tonight
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia?
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No.
I just wanna feel okay again
Just like our last kiss
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.
2 AM, who do you love?
That's how you got the girl.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
Don't look at me,
I just drive on by
We are never getting back together. Like, ever'
Asking God if he could play it again
Girl, why are you crying?
Written on the back of my hand.
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
Written on the back of my hand,
From everything we had
It all comes out
And I say, whoever said that did ought have too far to fall
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
I'm not much for dancing
You, picking on the weaker man
And I will do anything to see it through
He said be true 2 yourself &amp; keep your spirit free
But I kinda know that I won't get far
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
Oh, Oh, In the middle of the night
'Cause he is the reason for the tear drops on my guitar
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Where were you
Fell down a rabbit hole.
And I saw the story on the news
Yeah
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
Waited for something to come along
I don’t want to jinx my luck
I realize your laugh is the best sound
And I lived in your chess game
This is a big world, that was a small town
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Did you notice one less pair of hands
Tell her how you must have lost your mind. (uh-uh)
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I don't wanna need you this way,
So I thought –
We had a beautiful magic love there
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
We got nothing figured out,
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want.
'Til you put me down, oh
Without knowing anything at all.
in a field behind your yard,
Ellen works a long day
For a while I thought that I could hold you,
Flew me to places I'd never been
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.
She is the best thing that’s ever been mine.'
Come on, come along with me
Till the gravity is too much
I can't decide if it's a choice
But i can't believe you made me,
Taxi cabs and busy streets,
There's nothing stopping me
Drive all night
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
And make you realize.
It's not my fault I just couldn't see.
Would break down and cry
We were the Kings and the Queens
<i>[Music video version line:]</i> That's fine you won't mind if I say
And made blind
Ooh, you called me up again tonight
&amp; I know this time is like it's never been before
I walk to you
Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
I told myself, 'Don't get attached,'
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted
Raided and now cornered
and sometimes I think of you late at night
'We're here to die for our God.'
Maybe this year
'Til you open the door
Searching for a sound we hadn't
And she will never know your story like I do.
Oh, you will never go again
You can tell me when it's over
Maybe I have been going back too much lately
Oh, oh, (<i>[Sammy Adams:]</i> you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble (<i>[Sammy Adams:]</i> you know I'm)
Since she brought you down.
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
Today is never too late to be brand new
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
And I never knew I could feel that much
I will never judge you
And as I let you go
Think I'm finally clean
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
Lights flash and we will run for the fences
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
And I'd rather take a blow
So you can feel whole inside
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
Never impressed by me passing your tests
But I take it all back now
You will be the prince and I will be the princess,
I wear t-shirts
It seems like one of those nights,
I should have slept with one eye open at night.
Recalling words we said
And I said, 'I'm sorry too,'
Her hands are never cold, she is got Bette Davis eyes
That never bring you back to me,
Not this time
You held me so close
Fresh on the pavement
By the way, oh
I was reminiscing just the other day,
And soon enough you're best friends
And through the tears she said, 'I couldn't do that to you.'
The delicate beginning rush,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
That can’t help but shine through.
We were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Broke your heart, I will put it back together (together).
People are people, and sometimes it does not work out,
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
Or with a nasty scar
And you have got a smile
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
But I believe in whatever you do
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
(Died for you)
She is pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes
On the hood of his daddy's car
I wish you would
I will spend forever wondering if you knew
Left yourself in your warpath
And it is not you
And I thought was a star.
And every time you shine, I shine
I know you can't see me here
Play it again
And all we are is skin and bone
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Say that we will be together
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
Tell me did you sail across the sun
She will let you take her home, it her appetite
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
I know you were on my side
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why
Your necklace hanging from my neck
Cried into my bed
Hope it's nice where you are
Waking from this dream
Small talk, he drives
That had a tendency of getting stuck
Girl, that boy is trouble
Eyes, Eyes...Beautiful eyes
The secrets or my deepest fears.
What I was thinking of
Same old tired lonely place
Cause you have burned them out
Fall back on me baby,
Up until the nights got cold
There is not nothing bout you (there is not nothing bout you)
She can’t see the way your eyes
So I put on my make-up
Little did I know...
Standing there in my party dress,
Nowhere to hide,
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you
I'm standing on your street
A stranger in an all night diner
There is a video
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
Would never be the same
(Are we out of the woods?!)
And I see it when I'm looking at you
You be you and I will be me
Of your fears and your ghosts
Love like this changes who you are
You told me you loved me
And been trampled on
Comes back to me, burning red
And now that I can't put this down,
Took our broken hearts
Do you say,
I grabbed a pen
Come and trim my Christmas tree
That we won't forget this Sunday
We ditch the whole scene.
In the middle of the parking lot
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
Wish you could only see,
But I'm about to play my Ace
Don’t wait or say a single vow,
And remember what we were fighting for.
God, it's so painful
Back before you lost the one real thing you have ever known
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
He whispers songs into my window
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
And i know,
So you're the only thing on my mind
And I said, 'Oh my, what a marvelous tune.'
With you
Shepherds quake at the sight
You will find out
What if ribbons and bows did not mean a thing?
Never let nobody see him cry
I do remember the swing of your step
Baby this is what we do
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Burning red
I'm far away but I never let you go
Oh, red
Left a small town, never looked back
Don't need to get intimate...just yet
Lit through the darkness at one fifty eight
I know looks can be deceiving
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Say you're sorry
Like starlight, starlight
Back from the edge of time
You look like bad news.
You look like bad news,
Be that girl for a month
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
And you knew what it was
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day
She is like 'Oh, my god!' but I'm just gonna shake.
Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
'Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
I just stood there like a ghost
And I never (never) saw you coming
You're not sorry, no no, oh
Don't be afraid, we will make it out of this mess.
<i>[Post-Chorus:]</i>
You're tied together with a smile
Until I have forgotten all their names
Oh, oh
You weren't brought up that way.'
Think about the good times
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.
I'm love struck and looking out the window
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
2 AM, here we are
But they can't take what's ours
Blue jeans and a little dirt
No reasons why,
When he is taking my breath away
It's the morning of your very first day
A tear came to her eye
You put your coat around me
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
Another time and place
And you love the game
I don’t let nobody see me wishing he was mine
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
But I will hold you through the night until you smile
Mosaic broken hearts
Finally clean
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
You will see me in hindsight
And the sparks fly...
And never really had a chance
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
If we just keep dancing like we're
She stood alone on her balcony
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
And were your cousins late again
I don't feel welcome anymore
You're still an innocent,
The front porch steps
I did not say half the things I wanted to.
I did not know who I was supposed to be at fifteen
That's where I'm headed right now
You played in bars, you play guitar
Everybody here
Even though I know you're not there
There is something I can do
These days I haven't been sleeping,
Midnight,
And did not they call you?
Baby, what happened, please tell me
I guess you're in London today,
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she is so over it
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Oh oh oh.
I haven't seen them in a while.
These beats of a dark heart, use bass lines to replace you
Say that you wanna be with me too
But I'd give anything to have you here today
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
ten months sober, I must admit
You're still an innocent
But I don’t cause
Counting down the ways to see you
So I'm taking this chance to say
I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter.
And I said...
You never know if time will tell
I lose myself in a daydream
I hear the preacher say, 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.'
Remember that she is getting older too
I find myself at your door,
Not like this
We tried in vain
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.
Think I know it's with me.
You looked me in the eye
Lay down your guns
That's how you get the girl.
You break my heart in the blink of an eye.
Someone struck a match against the night,
Don’t fight me
You're not sorry no no oh
Light up when you smile.
And I'm on the bleachers
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Was not it easier in your lunch box days?
Take a deep breath, girl
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
To see my little girl's smile.
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
As we go through the rain
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
Down the aisle three men walked and said,
And I will do anything you say
Elevator buttons and morning air
He said, 'I got me a nice new apartment
And I, I’ve got you down,
The taxis pulled up on the very day of
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
With every single move
Could you tell me what more do I need
Baby I was naive,
Rose garden filled with thorns
Burning brighter than the sun
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
I hear the words but all I can think is
Counter all your quick remarks
That was not how it was supposed to be with me and you
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Yeah, I said, 'Leave,' but all I really want is you
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
By now I think you see that
Once upon a time,
Oh, take it easy now
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
Still got the same old number; just in case
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
American boy, living in the real world
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever),
It’s hard to fight when the fight is not fair
Where were you?
I have never heard silence quite this loud.
Not knowing it will be a long time going
In the front seat of his car
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
Love is a ruthless game
Don't forget, don't forget where I will be
Nothing comes true,
No proof, one touch
Forever and ever here
In the middle of the night.
I told you i'm not bulletproof
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
Oh, oh, (<i>[Sammy Adams:]</i> you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble
They can't take what's ours
And you know for me, it's always you
Oh, oh, oh,
You say sorry just for show
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
And I wish I could run to you.
You... you know I would die
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
Won't finish what you started
New soundtrack
Eh
Guess it did not given off rain.
Standing in front of you saying, 'I'm sorry for that night,'
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
All I know is a simple name
Absent-mindedly making me want you
That I had the best day
And I roll my eyes and then
Cried the whole way home
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I'm spinning out of control.
I threw my phone across the room at you.
My mind forgets to remind me
I can't resist
Now of you and me, similar Iraq
Hallelujah
Could have loved you all my life
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
So take a look what you have done (look what you have done)
And I thought it was a star.
I may see
I said, 'Oh my, what a marvelous tune'
Like I did before
You used to shine so bright
Oh, yeah
Though I wanna find
<i>[Taylor Swift:]</i> This is the last time you tell me I have got it wrong,
I have been holding back this feeling.
He will try to take away my pain
The rest of the world was black and white
Your hands are tough
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Just as long as you're mine
When they said, 'Speak now.'
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
And told me you loved me
I’m soaked to the skin, you’re warm and dry
And we will sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
And this year
'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
And I don't wanna need you this way,
And don't you leave 'cause I know
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better
My heart has never felt this way before
I might believe you if I did not know
You took a swing, I took it hard
Think of my head on your chest
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
And the conversation with the little white lies
And it's moving so fast
Is yesterday we were just children
When you think Tim McGraw
Don't say I did not say, I did not warn ya
Did not you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
And it was enchanting to meet you
But you're just so cool
But you don't have to call anymore
And it was like slow motion,
You took a Polaroid of us
But this is me swallowing my pride
He crept back in her memory
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
And an old napkin
I don't know how to be something you miss
But the time is ticking,
There must be an explanation,
Round yon virgin mother and child
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
They never blind me
Hold on, make it last
And look up smiling at you
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
There you are, on the street
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Here you are now
<i>[Ed Sheeran]</i>
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Then it makes you turn right back around
I think I am finally clean
Come on, come on, oh oh
Someday you will turn your radio on
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
Just another picture to burn!
I can't help myself.
I’ve watched you so long,
Oh, a simple complication,
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I’m guarded,
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
So he could wear you down.
Could end in burning flames or paradise
All the ways you made me feel alive
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Fall back on you
he is got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
Will you take a moment, promise me this
I bet you got pushed around
For me to try to tame
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
You said you'd be here.
And keeping lines blurry
Meet me in the pouring rain
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say 'Hello' to you
It's a run around the world
Standing next to me
So sorry, don’t worry
After everything and that little black dress
On a history book page
And it was over-rated
Living in the lie
I wish you'd could only see
And this love came back to me
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
Cause my first name big, last name trouble
All I could see was you and I.
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I'm so glad to see you smiling
I gotta have you.
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
When the night ends
Give me something that will haunt me when you're not around
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
You can feel it on the way home, way home
Is a letter that you never read
So I will go sit on the floor
Holding on
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
And we run
New money, suit and tie
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
I have always been a bit reckless
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And we drive and drive
I like the way you'd sing to me
Follow you around
Just like all those times before,
And I should have been there in the back of your mind
And if you come around saying sorry to me
But I hope someday you will take me away and save the day, yeah
I... I used to fly
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.
Takes me home
I was believing in you
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Busy streets and busy lives
At least you will know...
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
I'm no one special, just another
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
I always knew this time would come
And it rains when you're gone
Dream about
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I can still see you, this is not the best view
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Well, they're beautiful
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
'Cause loving him was red
And say, 'Hello, '
And I might be okay,
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
You should’ve known
But you know you wouldn't
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
And just as I reach out to touch you,
And the organ starts to play
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
It's 2 AM in my room.
He caught me staring at him
If the high was worth the pain
You saw me start to believe for the first time
Ha!
Minds change like the weather
I, I, I like it
So we’ve been out numbered
Am I right?
But with you I know it's no good
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...
Talk to the man who put you here,
You play it back
Every time the things got rocky, yeah
Counting my footsteps
I'm sorry
I just wanna open your eyes
Myself,
She did not have a reason to stay
Will you stay
Oh oh oh
Lose my number,
As if I don't already see them
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you
And it's too late for you and your white horse
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Little taste of Heaven
She is better known
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Oh my, what a marvelous tune
But you are everything to me.
And I can teach you bad, bad things
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I wish you would come back
Your name has echoed through my mind
Ooh-ooh
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
And I'm back for the first time since then
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
You ask me for my love then you push me around
And I’m not, I’m not oh
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
Lonely like a harbor line
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
And I stare at the phone,
She said, I was seven and you were nine
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
Jump then fall, baby,
The final blow hits you
Then I think there is something we all forgot
It drives you crazy
Had me in the palm of your hand
So it goes
Follow you, follow you home...
And when you're close I feel like coming undone
Two-thirty AM
And I'd be smart to walk away,
And you will will find out
In a snow covered little town
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore
Bet mama's wondering where we are
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you will be
I hold onto the night,
Let's hear the applause
And as we walked
A few years had gone and come around
And you have been getting closer and closer,
Someday you will...
You need to hear me out
Time moved too fast
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
So dust off your highest hopes
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Well, I'd rather you be mean
Stay, stay, stay.
My name's Heather
I know you're saying that you will be here anyway
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Fix my heart put on my make-up,
But that's not true, cause I know you...
It might just break me
I have got my eye on the door,
Here in my mind the sky looks the same
This is the last time I'm asking you,
You can feel it on the way home
It's really weird
I said, 'Leave,' but baby all I want is you
But I still mean every word I said to you
The rumors are terrible and cruel
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
You held your head like a hero
And I almost do.
growing up on Grandview avenue
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
We tell stories and you don't know why
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)
And it just keeps falling…
All you are is mean
Marry me, Juliet, you will never have to be alone.
Every little piece love,
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now
Oh I'm just a girl
It just all comes back. But he never does.
But just, baby, get along with me
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.
I was there when you said forever and always
But you're coming undone
I had the time of my life, with you
Jump then fall
Breathless
It all seems so simple
I see it all now that you're gone
And you flashback to
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
Only you can tell.
There is nothing I do better than revenge
I won't tell my friend
How strange that I don't know you at all.
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...
That's her daddy's name
It's miserable and magical.
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
I can read you like a magazine
You said forever and always, yeah
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
An i heart question mark, yeah
And six running horses under my hood
So it's gonna be forever
I looked up at the sky
But you changed the rules everyday
It's the same thing to me
Wanna see you pick up your phone,
And maybe get some sleep tonight.
Because I think I need one
Is is not your territory,
On the playground won't
No one wrote
There's pretty girls on every corner
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
But it made us turn right back around
Hey! Remember when you tried to write me off?
Too in love to think straight
Baby, we're the new romantics
We won't be sleeping
Out of focus, eye to eye
Wish I had concentrated,
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And you say, 'Let’s run away now,
And now it's all too late so you see
He’s funny, dark and tall
She is an actress, whoa
And I can care less that your famous
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
She walks to school with her arms crossed
I have ever heard
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up
And you just see right through me.
Sit at home and cry like a baby,
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
The world is spinning round
I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...
You better come down here right away.
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
When you said you needed space. (What?)
Talks business with my father
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain old Jane
And that's what they don't see,
Coffee at midnight
Whenever she walks by.
We can make the perfect couple
Don't you dream impossible things?
My faith in you was fading
I came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
I will give it to someone special
I just like hanging out with you all the time.
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
Time turns flames to embers
It turns out freedom is not nothing but missing you.
And they will be chasing their tails trying to track us down
It turns out freedom is not nothing but missing you,
I will catch you
I watch superman fly away
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
You better run
You showed me something that I couldn't see
And this is when the feeling sinks in,
Oh, who you are is not where you have been.
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
(Hey)
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Drive all night, just south of knowing why
You felt enough
And now you got me alone,
I can still feel your arms
I was not brought up that way
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
I could tell you his favorite color is green
Well I get so confused and frustrated
And my heart's not breaking
And I will take them down, take them down and open up the door for you
Oh, yeah...
Look at all this wasted time
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
suddenly he cheats, sent from above
Well count to ten, take it in
I got no one to believe in
I am not the kind of girl
All this time I was wasting,
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
The words that you whispered
That never knocked me off my feet
Would be bad for your health...
I'm coming off a little shy
You're all I wanted
Yeah, yeah
And all I have seen since eighteen hours ago
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again
And all you do is let me down
Drop everything now,
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
Oh let me think I'm strong
And I was crying on the staircase
When you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).
Long live the walls we crashed through
Tell me baby
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
While I stay at home
He can't see the smile I'm faking
Just like our last...
He walked around my life
She wears high heels,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh
We will pick up where we left off
I wonder what you're doing right now
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
We were talking –
I watch you talk, you did not notice
I ran off the plane
I will be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
I'd never seen it before
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha, in your wildest dreams, ah-ha.
And by morning, gone was any trace of you,
You are an expert at 'Sorry'
You were looking at me,
Emily opens her eyes
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
I'm sorry (eh eh)
I knew I had to go back home
And we will tell each other things, like I love you
And I wrote down our song
American boy, raising little babies
Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.
Before I let them see me
So good to hear your laugh
(Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)
You should not be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
Before fire could catch me
I seen it all –
I'm listening to the kind of music she does not like.
Braced myself for the 'Goodbye.'
And Emily – she is fading fast.'
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
Nobody ever lets me in
Whoa
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
You this was what you wanted
Like shadows in a faded light
She’s never gonna see the light
She will tease you, she will unease you
Before the monsters caught up to you?
What we had – a beautiful magic love there
I’ve left it all behind me
There’s a fire inside of you
Was it worth it?
Well maybe it’s me
Who you are is not what you did.
Forever more
I guess you really did it this time
And we will sing hallelujah, we will sing hallelujah
Fifteen
Look now -- the sky is gold
Before I met him
You put your arm around me for the first time.
Went in on casino
And you have got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me
Was as never meant to be caged in
We were lying on your couch
Lights are off, he is taking off his coat, yeah.
Burning, it was red
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, what are you thinking?
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
If you live like that you live with ghosts
Then discovered (then discovered)
Let me see your
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
All the better just to please you
The tricky thing
Disappear when you come back,
But I keep cruising
Well, it could have been easy
I wake up, I stretch out
Well, it's been a year, it does not surprise me
Jump then fall into me
It's something we all try to ignore
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
I was captivated.
James T. Johnson
If you love like that blood runs cold
Loving him was red
Oh, oh, (<i>[Sammy Adams:]</i> I told you I was, I was) trouble, trouble, trouble
Will my first love be true and real?
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
They never thought they'd see the day
But you saw enough
It's like no matter what I do.
When I loved you so, I should have known.
You would, you would if this was a movie
Are we in the clear yet?
Trouble, trouble, trouble
We small talk, work and the weather,
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
Everything will be alright (alright)
Well you can take me down with just one single blow
Something keeps me holding on to nothing
And I got my heart broken
But I took your matches
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
In dark blue Tennessee
Oh yeah, all right
Don't wanna come down
We blocked the noise with the sound of ‘I need you’,
And right there where we stood was holy ground.
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
Cause I, I know places we can hide
But none of us want to get there too soon
But they never blind me
That you will come in with the rain.
We could be a beautiful
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
Got me feeling like a nothing
These are the words I held back
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
You were wrong and i was right,
I have been giving out chances every time
And your eyes look like coming home
So jump then fall
But you had to talk about why,
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.
Keep your eyes open
I looked into your eyes
But sophistication is not what you wear or who you know
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
All I know is that you drove us off the road
I will be your everything tonight
That is the closest you will see me
And you're tied together with a smile
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
To do what is upstanding and right,
That's so fun!
Flashing lights and we
I haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn
Miss communications lead to fall-out.
Then you come around again and say
Standing in front of you saying, 'I'm sorry for that night.'
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
Walking through a crowd
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.
Somebody made you cold
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Apartment floors
You need to hear me out,
Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.
I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Get back to me (get back to me).
So overnight you look like a sixties’ queen.
Was not really in your heart
It jumps through your shirt
he is complicated, he is irrational
And I don't even know why
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
You hand me a rose and a note that says
La, la, la, la, la, la
But you held your pride like you should have held me.
You should have thought twice 'fore you let it all go
When you were putting up the lights this year
Even though I'm not the only one
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate because we are going down,
And don't hate me for loving you
Our song is the slamming screen door,
In the sky, oh my my my...
just listen to the crickets sing.
As I comb back through my memory,
So here's to everything
What would happen if presents all went away?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Come on, come on
I said, 'This time I have had enough.'
Christ the savior is born
'Run as fast as you can.'
It's been waiting for you
All the time.
A ring
Maybe we will stop talking and I will haunt you like a ghost
May these memories break our fall
My mama says that it will be alright
And I know all the steps up to your door,
Firefly
I bet this time of night you're still up.
Welcome to New York (New York)
I could stand up and sing you a song,
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't
But there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this
I'd open up and you would say, 'Hey,
Are we out of the woods yet?
When you look down and see,
I’d lie
Now baby don't you break my heart
My name's Gracie
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds.'
This is looking like a contest,
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And you made it so real
And everybody's here
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
Someday when you leave me
And did not they pray too?
He did not like it when I wore high heels
And i still love you
Cause this song is all about Ellen
Please tell me if you’ve seen one
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is a state of grace
You say sorry just for show (hey)
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
You can Jump then fall, jump then fall
It rains when you're here
Oh, oh I'm caught up in you
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Like 'Oh my, what a marvelous tune.'
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
You said forever and always... yeah
For us to finally win
And the seven dwarfs
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
Had gone all wrong
Cause I honestly believed in you
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
I don't know why
And she will tease you, she will unease you
And the first thing that you will read is:
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You are in love, true love
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
But every night with us is like a dream
On the side-lines wishing for right now
Is touch and go
And everybody believed in you?
So he drives down to
This is surely not what you thought it would be
It's two A.M.
Come now running headlong
I like the way you wanted me
And thanking God that you weren't here
Not knowing it'd be a long time going
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
And there’s a drawer of my things at your place.
But if you look a little closer
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
It's hard to make a conversation
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Tonight we will stand, get off our knees
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
But we will stand up champions tonight
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
I got an i heart question mark,
She is upset, she is going off about something that you said
So I am going to stay through it all
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
And then you feel so low
That could light up this whole town.
When I still see it all in my head
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
Something's made your eyes go cold
That never gets told
I looked at you like the stars that shined
And you're doing your best to avoid me.
No!
And love will find you one way or another
Took off faster than a green light 'Go'.
All the things that we wished they would always do?
I don't think so
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
My momma stood across the room
Sitting fishing by the river bank
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
We're a crooked love in a straight line down.
Cause everything I want is miles away
Ooh ooh dancing with me
After everything that day
With you today
Oh oh
And another winter's on the way
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
My god if I could only say,
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
When tears are streaming down your face
We did not take that interstate
Just twin fire signs
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
I remember, oh, I remember
Don’t wait or say a single vow
Were you just kidding?
And they will tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Kiss me on the sidewalk
But is not it funny how
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Come back, come back, come back to me like
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
Why I should be the one you choose.
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
In the sky, the pretty lights
It's how you get the girl, girl...
We are the Kings and the Queens
This revolution, throw your hands up
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would
He looks around the room
And here's to you and your temper
I found from back when I was three
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
And when I fell hard you took a step back
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
And pray for a miracle
'Cause we never gave in
And now I see, now I see, now I see
Across the room your silhouette
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
There is not no accidents in what we do
Trying to figure out what is and is not true.
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
The way you talk, the way you tease
But you're quicksand
Throwing pennies at the fountain,
You wish you had stayed
And his voice is a familiar sound,
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
I like my trucks a little
Sat on the floor
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
You come and pick me up, no headlights
And looking back on all of that, it's nice to believe
I said remember this feeling
The days drag on
We are too busy dancing
Never knew I could feel that much
And you made me believe
This is the last straw
Looking so innocent,
Hey, all you had to do was stay
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever).'
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
he is the reason for the tear drops on my guitar
One without a permanent scar
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
I hope your life lead you back to my door
I slammed the door
You will still wonder
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
We're burning red
Really weird
(Keep your eyes open)
And then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all
Did I say something way too honest?
And I wish you knew that I will never forget you as long as I live.
Once bitten and twice shied
Please back up, oh back up
And the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives
Meant just for you
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you.
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
But I am not alone
Just know I’m right here hoping,
Ooh, I knew.
Comes out just when you need it to
And you stood there in front of me
But I'm not picking up
All the girls that you have run dry have tired lifeless eyes
In front of everyone you know?
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you have changed
And she says that
With every Christmas card I write
But I don’t wanna’ go there anymore…
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
Wearing your clothes
Uh oh!
I thought I had you in my hand,
Emily's home late again
But for me it's just a lonely time
Missed yourself
The drought was the very worst
Just one more thing to do
And they get what they want cause you're gone
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Right when I was just about to fall
I'm not sure how I got there,
Saw you there and I thought
Chasing fortune and fame.
A drunken driver missed an over pass.
In red lipstick,
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
'Cause nothing's as it seems
Think about what i,
Take it easy baby
That's when I could finally breathe
She will take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
In the middle of the night
Once upon a time
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.
September saw a month of tears
I have never been anywhere cold as you
He keeps his word
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
I'd be fine if you just walked by,
I do recall now the smell of the rain
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Keep your ey-eyes open
The feeling you can know so much,
One night he wakes
And they're all standing around me singing
Wake up and smell the break-up
Far enough away
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
It's like I got this music
'Cause baby, now we have got bad blood, hey!
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
When I left I wanted you to chase after me
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
Ever since you have been gone
I have been doing fine without you, really
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart
I will be eighty-seven; you will be eighty-nine
I will meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door.
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
Because the last time you saw me
I walked out and said, 'I'm setting you free,'
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Forget what i'm trying to say, oh
Why..do you have to make me feel small
And he is long gone when he is next to me
And if you asked me if I love him
Everything will be alright
I sat down and cried
It's probably better off this way.
Come on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)
I’m sure there are so many girls
I'm looking good
If you're moving on,
I hope you think my favorite song
I said, 'Leave,' but all I really want is you
You're better off,
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
And you will know you did not beat me,
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He’s got everything you’d wanna be
It won't be anything like, anything like
So take a look what you have done
Baby, I did not say my vows,
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
And you don't know it, do you?
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
Got to the hallway,
This year, to save me from tears
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
So don't look at me,
the greatest living hero that ever was
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears,
And I had the best days with you
It will leave you breathless
I don't wanna live without you.
When you come back down
And I'm only me when I'm with you.
Got lost in your eyes
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
Was I out of line?
Taking flight, making me feel right like
Who you are is not what you did
You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...
he is so bad but he does it so well
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
I keep going back over things we both said
Last night I heard my own heart beating
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Don’t try me
Past the pumpkin patch
Not his price to pay...
Boy, you might have me believing
Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
Ask anyone.
You have knocked me off my feet again
Please tell them my name
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
And I remember thinking
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your getting ready for school
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you will come back each time you leave
Just waiting for you to walk in,
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
What do you say
Crazy and a little rough
This is me praying that
Tell me why
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
Heart break is the national anthem
It's fearless.
Ooh ooh we could get married
But for you I did
Just close enough to touch
Oh-oh, yeah.
Baby you showed me what living is for
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
My last request it is
So baby, make me fly
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
With his head in his hands and she is just 7 miles away
'Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
And risk another goodbye.
Without me, without me, without me
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
And it's two A M and I'm cursing your name
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
In only a little while... I will cry
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend) wildest dreams, ah-ha, in your wildest dreams, ah-ha
Nothing can harm you here
I don't wanna miss you like this,
I don't wanna miss you like this.
And every time you shine, I will shine for you
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie,
She is precocious
And I watch you fly around the world
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
She did not have a reason to go, oh no
Who understands you?
So if the chain is on your door I understand.
If you only knew me
Uh huh
All you had to do was stay
Who understands you,
Who understands you.
I don't know about you
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
But your close friends always seem to know
And the sinking feeling starts,
Winds of change blew you away from me
Here's to silence
There's gotta be more
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Just watched Stephen run across the field
Staying up, playing back myself leaving.
And you're talking to me
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
He said, 'Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
Now at school
Thinking about him
I hold onto the night
And I hope you don't save some other girl
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.
A long time going
Tangled up with you all night
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
She almost called him on the night that he wrote
Yeah oh
So fall back on me,
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful
I was trying to fly
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
And you're thinking we will be fine again,
I hear the sound of my own voice
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
To stand back where you stood
This love is good, this love is bad
That someday you will find me
Wait right by the phone every night,
On the way home
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
Should have burst through the door,
When we first dropped our bags on
Bigger than the rest
You spin me around
And no one will desert you
You should have known that word, with what you did with her,
When it was hard to take,
But not this time around
No... no, no, no...
You're in the car on the way to the movies
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby
But I don't wanna' go there anymore,
I will be here, today and here tomorrow
the hope of an american boy
Like any true love
I thought you'­d want to know
Never thought I'd see it...
Look at what we have found
Nice to meet you, where you been?
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
But just look what i have created
You and I walk a fragile line
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
'Cause I'm going to see my daddy tonight
We show off our different scarlet letters—
But loving him was red
From going out with all of your best friends
I wish we could go back
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny <i>[radio version]</i>
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
If only you had seen what you know now then
And they read off our names
You're a bad idea
For the next four years in this town
Because these things will change
And you can tell me that you're sorry
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Unless you play it good and right
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
Everybody knows that,
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
But, honey, most of them are true
Take that innocent heart
I have been an awful good girl, santa baby
So they could cut her down.
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
Don’t say 'Yes', run away now,
I almost do,
After all this time, you and I
I almost do.
Baby, what about the ending
I'm breaking, no past
Until you come up blue, she is got Bette Davis eyes
You just see right through me
And everybody knows that,
If it's wrong and
And life makes love look hard
Everything is better.
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
And when you find everything you looked for
Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
The lights are so bright
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
Really something,
You know it used to be mad love
And, baby, I have got nowhere to go
In case you haven't heard,
Be there, never gonna leave you
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
I will bet she is beautiful, that girl he talks about,
Let me love you, kiss you
Breaking down and coming undone
Baby I will fall back on you
Every sky was your own kind of blue
Jump then fall into me, into me
Starts to make its way to me
So let me say it real slow
Now it’s big black cars, and Riviera views,
And they said, 'Speak now.'
Oh-oh.
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.
I'm not the one you will sweep off her feet,
Running free
You, with your switching sides
Firefly you drew me to you
And I'm tired of being last to know
Fall back on me
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,
About a little thing called love
These are the hands of fate
And I was too cloudy,
Heart beats under coats
Just a small town boy and girl
Yeah,
I see you turn off your phone,
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
Calling commotion to my emotions
We ditch the whole scene
And when we have had our very last kiss
Chase the wind
Soon she is gonna find
Son of God
And there he goes, so perfectly,
Just pretending
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
I have watched from a distance as you made life your own
Glories stream from Heaven afar
I’d like to know just where to go
The crowds in stands went wild
You were in college working part time waiting tables
Do you say what you mean?
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
At least that's what people say,
That starting over would look so good on you
I wanna feel you by my side
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
Both me and my baby
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Your mum and daddy’s walls
I have got an i heart question mark,
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
I say, 'Just fine'
But here I am
Flash forward and we’re taking on the world together,
I will still look at you like the stars that shine
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Since the beginning of the year
You will be in another town
Never knew that I could feel this much
And it's this time of year
Just let it flow
Do you mean what you say?
Now we have got problems
And crawl out the window
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, 'Okay, let's talk.'
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
Coming down to nothing
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
Oh, but something's different this time,
This path is reckless
I was enchanted to meet you
Boys and boys and
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Talking over a football game
And I go back to December all the time.
As I was leaving too soon
We get so caught up in all of it
And now you're asking me to listen
I'm so in love that I acted insane
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
Well I will wait up for you, dear, santa baby
But that's ok
I wish I could keep you firefly
And you got your share of secrets
You still look amazing
And I can see you years from now in a bar
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
When your birthday passed and I did not call.
I just wanna show you
So I will watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I stare at the phone
Is not it funny how many times we can say,
He smiles, it's like the radio
You had me crying for you honey
I remember
Confetti falls to the ground
My heart's still breaking
And you don’t even know where I start.
Is the one who did not show?
Long were the nights when
Do you mean,
But there was one thing missing,
Any day now, they're talking war
And don't know how my friends
And I know there's a God because I met him
'Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did'
You found me, you found me, you found me
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Everything I need is right here by my side.
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You keep his shirt
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
We know what we don't have to say
And I’ve loved in shades of wrong
The beat of your heart
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Take me home
And I can't hear one single word they say
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
So I punched a hole in the roof
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
Good
It's getting cold
And it will be a long time, long time going
I'm lightning on my feet
(Hold on) do you believe it?
She was an American girl
Why you gotta be so?...
And I said,
The night goes dark
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of forty five
Uh oh, uh oh,
Are covered up in pictures of you
You're thinking that I hate you now
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
He tells me about his night
Did not they tell us don't rush into things?
Oh my God, look at that face
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?
You have got a busy day today
But would they write a song for you?
Some say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
And that's what they don't know,
Missing him was dark grey all alone
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
And i will bet, you thought you'd beat me
I thought was a star,
Oh, but if it don't
He stands over the hospital bed
And talking turned to screams.
And we were dancing, dancing
Trying to get some help from up above
I don't even know her,
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Did you forget everything?
Heavenly hosts sing
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'.
'I did not bring you up
Heard before
And when you find everything you looked for,
You pull my chair out and help me in
Next chapter.
It was the night things changed
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
Can't help myself,
Oh.
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Staying back and watching me shine
I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Not even that is enough
Remind me how it used to be.
And it is not you oh
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
Who means the most to you
twenty two, ooh-ooh
Every night from the radio
She is not a saint
We, oh, getting back together, oh,
And then reality crept in, and erased it.
You were looking at me
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
Baby, let me love you,
And my daddy said, 'Stay away from Juliet'
Just so frustrating intoxicating
oh, sinking ships
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
Let me remind
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
I stay out too late
But I’m only looking at you.
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Took a wrong turn and we
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
living in a crazy world.
Somewhere else
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
And we talk and window-shop
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
I wish you knew that I will never forget you as long as I live.
He sees everything black and white
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
He is sensible and so incredible
I was in your sights, you got me alone
Oh my my my my
Ooh, hanging with my baby
She said, 'I wish there was some way
Say you will remember me standing in a nice dress,
Yeah, yeah, red
You put your eyes on me
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.
I'm not usually this way
If you asked me if I love him
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door
Say it's been a long 6 months
Picked me up late one night out the window,
With no one to impress,
Find things they never found
The stakes are high, the water's rough
You made a really deep cut
Time for a little revenge
There's so much more
This love is glowing in the dark
I hope you remember
You saw me there, but never knew
And, baby, now we got bad blood
When you think happiness
Since his return from the stay on the moon
You ended it
looking for the love
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
All my days I will know your face
When it comes to you.
Outrun my gun
He tried to teach me from the very start
What I wanted
The closer that we get
It was all a little
But it's something i just fell into,
Hanging with my baby, my baby
The more I think about it now the less I know
I need reasons why you're leaving
And it's a beautiful day
I have an excellent father
The night you danced like you knew our lives
'Cause my heart is yours
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
And we will tell each other things like I need you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
Don’t you?
Where were you? Where were you?
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
A new notch in your belt is all I will ever be
Cory finds another way to be
You're my best friend
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
That's what we thought
You could have helped if you had wanted to
South of France to Reno
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
In your life you will do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
And I am hiding in the curtains
Hope you know this is not easy, easy for me.
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
You chase down the newest thing,
I can see the end as it begins
And all I can say is come closer
Baby all I want is you
We're driving down the road
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Down came the rain
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
I should not be asking myself, 'Why?'
There was nothing left to do
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.
We are never ever ever getting back together
And I hope the sun shines
The jury's out, but my choice is you
I wish you would, I wish you would
He says he is so in love, he is finally got it right,
This love left a permanent mark
I had to,
I hope it takes you back to that place
And don't rip my heart out
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
And you tell me about your dreams.
You can walk away, say we don’t need this
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
Counting all the scars you made
Playing soldiers
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
I pass the pictures around
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I confess, babe,
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
When time stood still and I had you
I know that we could work it out somehow
Before you ask me if i'm alright,
All the boys think she is a spy, she is got Bette Davis eyes
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
Keep your ey-eyes
When you started crying, baby, I did, too
And my blind optimism to blame
This was the very first page
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
I wonder if he knows he is all I think about at night
Baby, what happened, please tell me?
But I swore I was fine
Well now he is back in the atmosphere
This morning I said we should talk about it.
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
You can see it with the lights out
I know your favorite songs,
thirty two, and still growing up now
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
Unbelievable
And I am not your typical princess
See me cry
Saying, 'Does he know?'
How do I get it back the way it was before?
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
Keep your aim locked
And I know it's long gone
I'm dying to see how this one ends
So many things that I wish you knew,
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
Don’t say 'Yes', run away now
Something so beautiful and free,
I couldn't ask for anything better
We need love, but all we want is danger
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
It's not unbroken anymore.
Put them in a drawer
I will follow you, follow you home...
And now I'm pacing back and forth
And you come away with a great little story
'I want you for worse or for better,
I'm looking through your eyes
Before the fight, before I locked you out
Like a million little stars, spelling out your name
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Lighthearted joke
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
Cause it's worked each time before
It could burn out
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And I don't try to hide my tears.
So I will just get my coat
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
Like waves crashing on the beach
And I will write your name
'Cause these things will change
And you know it’s all the same,
State the obvious, I did not get my perfect fantasy
To cross above my head
All I know is you held the door
You wish it was me,
We found wonderland
he is staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,
Faster than my bullet
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
Tell myself I must be crazy,
I’ve never been there
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
And for once you let go
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
You fight and you talk
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.
When I jumped in,
After everything I must confess, I need you
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Diving off into the deep end,
And unfamiliar exit signs?
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Don't you think I was too young
Still believing there might come a day
If you could see
And you're momma is waiting up and you think he is the one
We were both young when I first saw you.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.
You and I
My love
You should have been here.
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him
Probably mindless dreaming,
Did not you flash your green eyes at me?
Don't walk away now
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Please leave me stranded,
And we held them up for our town
And I'm only me
On back roads at night
At ten oh clock she hears this screaming
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
You never let me drive
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
And I never (never) saw you coming
And let me know that it's not all in my mind.
Always end up dancing
The light reflects
Whoa, oh, I need you baby
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
Can't stop thinking about you,' and I...
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
I reached for you but you were gone
Every single time I come on this show
Was I mistaken?
Innocently overlooks the truth
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.
Like any great love it keeps you
I'm just another thing for you
Come back I will be with you someday
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
You should have said 'No', you should have gone home
To be messed with?
The chain on your neck
I tried to take the road less traveled by
You come to my door
Let's consider this lesson learned.
But there were Christmases when I did not wonder how you are tonight
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
except ending.
And you will never see, sing me to sleep
But like the trees we cut our names in,
So he could be home that night
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky,
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forever the name on my lips
Someday I will be big enough so you can't hit me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
But by the way
And I’ve been hoping every day
I'm lying here in invisible arms
Cause, Every single time I come on this show
And when the sun came up, you were looking at me
It was a few years later, I showed up here.
I say, 'I heard, oh, that you have been out and about with some other girl, some other girl.'
Did you not write it down
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Back up, baby back up
I say, 'Nothing,
Tell me what would you find
I have been on this show
She is never gonna love you like I want to.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
I never dreamed of this
Kiss me on the sidewalk,
Cherry lips, crystal skies
He’d never tell you but he can play guitar
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
But you're coming undone... oh
I don't wanna hide anymore
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
On the steering wheel
She knows you, she is got Bette Davis Eyes
Oh, think of me
The end.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
If you have children some day
Letting my heart linger
Oh, but if it don't,
To see me like that
And meet me there tonight
It was enchanting to meet you,
So, why can't you see
Oh, I'm holding my breath
He always said he did not get this song
I like the way you needed me
All around your feet
You opened my eyes
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong.
Think I know where you belong,
Oh, I stare at the phone,
That you will stand by me forever
Did you not write it down?
Christ our savior is born
You're on the phone with your girlfriend
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
Was not it beautiful when you believed in everything
<i>[Taylor Swift]</i>
Just take me home
I have burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
And it would be a fine proposition,
Don’t you think I was too young?
I got tired of waiting
twenty two, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
The battle that we swore
But in my mind I play it back,
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
I go back to December all the time.
But we got bills to pay,
If you ever wondered
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you.'
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And they will tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
And took the earliest flight
I'm aching, no past
Well now he is back from that soul vacation
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
So you don't have to call anymore
Hold on to spinning around
Met her out in Vegas
I want to be everything you need
You stayed outside till the morning light
To roll your eyes at, honey
Wonder what you're doing right now
Just like the ones I used to know
To my loving bed
Everybody here was someone else
You had to fight to have the upper hand
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Stardom pushed across the line
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:
A love that's gonna last
<i>[Spoken:]</i> You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?
She is finally well enough to travel
He sees that boy drive away
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
That I can't even see anyone when he is with me
Hold on, never turn back
And you gotta live with the bad blood now
You said it in a simple way,
That's what they don't see
I have found that time can heal most anything
When you play the fool
I'm taking pictures in my mind
Did not matter where I'd been
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!
But it said enough
She says, 'Please, don't make me go back there again.'
It was losing me.
Like, ever...
‘Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
